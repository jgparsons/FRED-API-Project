        <p class="text-muted mb-2">
          Policy rates shape borrowing costs for everything from credit cards and auto loans
          to business investment and housing. Understanding how they move is essential
          for anyone interested in macro, markets, or finance.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted mb-0">
          Our goal was to make this information easier to follow for students and early-career
          analysts who don’t have time to parse every FOMC release.
